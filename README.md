# Casually Docs
Under construction ⚒️ 

Interactive documentation site for the upcoming [Casually Components](https://github.com/andreaabellera/Casually-Components) and [Casually CSS](https://github.com/andreaabellera/Casually-CSS). Also an excuse to learn full-stack ASP.NET + Azure and see if Blazor can indeed use my npm packages. When all things fail, pretend you saw nothing 😂🤫

Worth a try.
